//! Layer L2: command registry, history and export.
//!
//! Every user-visible action is a command with a stable id (`data.import`, `nca.run`,
//! `fit.run`...), JSON parameters and a JSON result (golden rule 4). The UI, the CLI, the MCP
//! server and agents all go through [`Engine::execute`]; [`describe`] lists the commands with the
//! JSON Schema of their parameters and results, the same values the MCP server serves.
//!
//! An [`Engine`] owns a [`Project`] and an append-only [`History`] of the commands it executed.
//! Each entry of the history carries a [`Seal`](seal::Seal): a SHA-256 of the command, its
//! parameters and its answer, so that a saved project can be replayed and checked bit for bit
//! (`project.replay`). There is no file access here and the engine reads no clock: a CSV comes in
//! as text or bytes, a saved project goes out as bytes, the program that runs the engine may give
//! it a clock ([`Engine::set_clock`]) to date the entries, so the crate compiles to WebAssembly.
//!
//! A command that fails leaves the project as it was.
